### **Prototype** 
will be a breadboard version with a oled screen just hanging off, this is what ill use to code
the finished product will be the enclosure which can press the buttons from afar or the buttons can be moved, 
it will need a way to hold the oled in place quite sturdily. 

I think we can probably get the prototype done in 2 weeks easy.
